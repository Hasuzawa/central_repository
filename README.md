## Techs used


This mini website is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, standard React, HTTP, TS etc.

## Getting Started

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## technical commentary

<ul>
    <li>This time I used another CSS framework (Tailwind). I have noticed that the biggest advantage of using a CSS framework is not because it can accomplish more than vanilla CSS, but to enforce a particular practice and styling so that the code
    can be understood by someone who has not worked on it. This is not relevant here but it is definitely a great plus in
    collaboration or real workplace.
